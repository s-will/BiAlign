TODO ideas:
==========

For comparison: Implement standard alignment (without the possibility to shift) which
uses exactly the same scoring model
  -- could be quickly implemented by setting shift cost to (quasi)infinity


Add output of structure string representations with the alignment


Implement partition function: subopt sampling, forward/backward-->edge probabilities

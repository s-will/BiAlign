0.3a (Oct 20 2021)
    * Implement efficient affine gap cost alignment
	  with O(n^2 max_shift^2) time complexity, 9 states and 15 cases per state
    * Preserve implementation of non-affine algorithm
	  (it is automatically chosen for gap_opening_cost 0)
    * Use sparse DP matrix O(n^2 max_shift^2)
    * Support similarity matrix for protein comparison, include BLOSUM62
    * Rewrite code for compilation with Cython and optimize due to static typing
    * Support input from files
0.2 (Feb 14 2020)
    corresponding to the LNBI-CIBB post-proceedings submission
    * add version option
    * more flexible, prettier output of result bi-alignment
0.1 (May 03, 2019)
   corresponding to the CIBB conference submission
   *  stral-like scoring of structure
   *  highlighting in output
   *  basic bi-alignment functionality (treat bi-alignments like four-way
   *  alignments)
pre-versions:
    incomplete bi-alignment as three-way alignment
